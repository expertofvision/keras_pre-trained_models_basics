# keras_pre-trained_models_basics

This source code is python implementation of [26 pre-trained models](https://keras.io/api/applications/) on imagenet dataset available in Keras application API. Each model can be used for classification on single input image or features vector of the image can be extracted.

## Running the Code

1. Download the source code.
2. Create conda environment using following command. For more [Help](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

    conda env create -f tl_pre_trained_models_env.yml

3. Activate the environment using following.

    conda activate tl_pre_trained_models_env

4. You can also see list of installed environments using following.

    conda env list

5. Open main.py. Un-comment any call to any model and save.
6. Run main.py using following.

    python3 main.py


## Good Luck!
